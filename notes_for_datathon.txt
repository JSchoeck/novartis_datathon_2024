Not enough data -> cold start

we have a lot of data of past info

using all data of past data, predict future target data / costs 

pieces of data are "vectors"

we want to find the other pieces of data that are most similar past datapoints and then predict future

OR can also use mean or nearest neighbour calculations

NIXTLA using masking

cold start - back testing - true backtesting if possible if possible use true cold testing


How to go about creating this cold case:

-get raw data - train raw + test raw (submission?)
-filter data
-ascribe meta-data columns
-normalize target value? (make it try and reach 1?)
-consider special treatment for negative values
-remove / stop including weird or unnecessary data remove duplicates
-train?
-models to use potentially: Overall Mean, XGBoost, CatBoost, 
-cluster_nl + date is unique ID for a row - can remove duplicates i think

-throw out all data that is older than 1 year


Saturday
- remove outliers - find outliers
- negative 1 values, what do we do with it.
- potentially look into different python models?



-sales in first 12 months
-primary key being cluster_nl and drug_id
-create new column -> sales_firt_year
-fill this with sum of the target for the first year of that drugs / clusternl's
-remove data from first 12 months as it is invalid
